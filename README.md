# AIProject2
This project is a simple text generator using markov chains. The source code is written in python, therefore a python interpretor is required. The brown corpus is used to generate the Markov chains.

Once all dependencies are downloaded, run the command "python main.py". You will be met with a prompt asking for your starting word(which must be in the brown corpus). Once entered you will be asked length for the sentence. With both pieces of information the program will create a sentence of specified length based off of the starting word. A new prompt asking if you would like to exit or try again will appear.

Dependencies:
    NLTK
